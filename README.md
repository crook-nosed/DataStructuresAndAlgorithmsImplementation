# Data Structures and Algorithms Implementations

In this repo, I will add  implementation of data structures and algorithmic paradigms in different languages that i will learn over time. 
Currently implementations are in C and C++.
The goal is to make me familiar with how to implement common data structures and algorithms that is necessary for computer science students.

Next languages on the way are python and javascript and maybe java after that
