Upcoming possible data structure implementations in mind:
1. to implement queue using array.
2. to improve implementation of array with stack
3. to implement level order traversal for binary tree
4. to implement insertion,search and bf and df traversals in binary search tree
5. to implement priority queue with sorted and unsorted list.
6. to implement priority queue with sorted and unsorted arrays.
7. to implement priority queue with heap.
8. to implement complete binary tree.
9. to implement different kinds of heaps.
10. to implement a non-binary tree.
11. to implement naive and efficient implementations of disjoint sets.
12. to templatize all the written data structures and c++
13. to implement my own stl in c++
14. to implement these data structures in other languages(limited to c,python and java).
